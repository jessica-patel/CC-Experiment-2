Experiment 2, Multiscreen
Group B: "Where's Tiger?" Game 2
Group members: Aranya, Yu, Aishwarya, Jessica

This code was written as part of a group experience for 12 or more mobile phones to look for a lost dog named Tiger.

This is game 2 which displays a word in the center of the phone screen. Participants must keep their phones on a flat surface and rotate to reveal one of twelve different words, save it by tapping the screen and then combine it into a larger sentance in order to find the dog.

This code uses the iOS sensor access code (with accompanying permissions.js file) shared by Nicholas Puckett in Creation & Computation, Digital Futures, M.Des, 2023-2025
